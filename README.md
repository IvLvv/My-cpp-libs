## First Library: Matrix Operations

### Overview

The first library in this repository is designed to provide matrix operations. It includes a set of functions and classes that facilitate matrix addition, multiplication, transposition, and more.

### Features

- **Matrix Addition**: Add two matrices of the same dimensions.
- **Matrix Multiplication**: Multiply two matrices with compatible dimensions.
- **Matrix Transposition**: Transpose a given matrix.
- **Matrix Printing**: Print the matrix to the console.

### Installation

To use this library, include the following file in your project:

```cpp
#include "matrix.h"
```

### Usage

Here is an example of how to use the Matrix library:

```cpp
#include "matrix.h"

int main() {
    Matrix mat1({{1, 2}, {3, 4}});
    Matrix mat2({{5, 6}, {7, 8}});

    Matrix result = mat1.add(mat2);
    result.print();

    return 0;
}
```

This will output:

```
6 8 
10 12 
```

For more detailed usage, refer to the comments and documentation within the `matrix.h` file.
